# Performance-Notifier
A small C# application that monitors CPU and RAM usage in the background and notifies when limits are exceeded.
It was written by me one or two years ago before I heard the phrase "clean code", so just keep it in mind.

# Usage 
It is the easiest to [download the release](https://github.com/janekb04/Performance-Notifier/releases/tag/1.0). Alternatively, clone the code and compile with Visual Studio. To use, make sure to place the executable somewhere, where it won't get deleted by accident. Then run it once. Done. The app will run in background and send notifications when it will detect high CPU or RAM usage. To open the beautiful GUI, click the icon in the taskbar.
